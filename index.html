        <p>This site is dedicated to dissecting the impact of media on our perceptions of sexuality, and shining a light on the sexual objectification that permeates popular culture.

If you hadn't already noticed, I made everything UT themed! Also this wasn't made in Wix or anything like that - I wrote all the code myself. So I apologize for the less-than-perfect formatting.</p>
